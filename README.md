### About

- This modpack's purpose is to serve as an open alternative to those popular clients, such as Lunar.

- I left these since:

	A. They're not that customizable and impose a lot of stuff on the user.<br>*(You can disable anything in the modpack if you don't like it, fyi.)*
	
	B. Everywhere you go, you see the "give us money" popups and alerts.<br>*(e.g. Cosmetica offers as much cosmetics as, if not more than, Lunar and they're completely free.)*
	
	C. Have you ever checked what Lunar sends to their telemetry server when you use it? Like if it wasn't enough that you can't turn off Snooper.<br>*(Unless you have a mod, like the one in this modpack)*

### Modlist

⚠️ **Required** (for one reason or another) | 💖 **Recommended** (to keep on) | 🫵 **Optional** (on/off, doesn't matter) | ✋ **More steps** (optional, with more setup needed)

#### Base

- ⚠️ **Fabric API** - used by other mods
- ⚠️ **Fabric Language Kotlin** - used by other mods

#### GUI

- 💖 **AppleSkin** - gives you info about food and how much hunger they restore
- 🫵 **Better Ping Display** - depends if you're satisfied with the default colored bars
- 💖 **Controlling (+ Searchables)** - very useful for finding empty and conflicting key-binds
- 💖 **Mod Menu** - similar to the menu in Forge, gives a pretty overview of all the mods
- 💖 **YetAnotherConfigLib** - same as above, plus allows to modify mods in-game instead of going through the config files
- 🫵 **Simple Hud Enhanced** - depends if you want the extra info it provides or not
- 🫵 **Sprint Indicator** - recommend to those who use toggle sprint
- 🫵 **SprintAfterDeath** - same as above

#### "Optifines"

- 🫵 **AmbientEnvironments** - mixes grass color, I like it, depends if you want it or not
- 💖 **CIT Resewn** - if you're using the resource packs below, it's a necessity
- 🫵 **Cubes Without Borders** - true borderless finally comes to Minecraft
- 💖 **Cull Leaves** - optifine had this, might help with performance while keeping those pretty transparent leaves
- 💖 **Entity Model Features** - if you're using the resource packs below, it's a necessity
- 💖 **Entity Texture Features** - same as above
- 💖 **Fusion** - not really sure if the resource packs below use this, but connected textures are still pretty cool
- 🫵 **Iris** - you only need this if you plan on using shaders
- 💖 **Reese's Sodium Options** - this goes together with Sodium without saying
- 💖 **Sodium** - Optifine, but better, actually works and is on Fabric, in other words a must-have
- 💖 **Sodium Extras** - this goes together with Sodium without saying
- 💖 **WI Zoom** - another feature from Optifine, which I can't but recommend

#### Other Optimizers

*All of these below are a mystery to me, but they seem to work and do their job well, so I can fully recommend them.*

- 💖 **FerriteCore** - reduces memory usage
- 💖 **FPS Reducer** - reduces GPU and CPU usage when you're idle
- 💖 **Lithium** - makes a lot of performance improvements
- 💖 **Memory Leak Fix** - does what it say on the tin
- 💖 **ModernFix** - another mix of performance improvements
- 💖 **No Telemetry** - disables the Snooper

#### Cosmetics

- 🫵 **Cosmetica** - free alternative to Lunar and such cosmetics *(fox ears and rainbow capes go brrr~)*
- 🫵 **Not Enough Animations** - wow, that is really cool
- 🫵 **Simple RPC (+ CraterLib)** - if you wanna support the project
- 🫵 **WaveyCapes** - capes go woosh~ in the wind!
#### Social
- ✋ **Plasmo Voice** - (SERVER-SIDE REQUIRED) - proximity voice chat, does nothing if it isn't also installed on the server

### FAQ

**Q: Will this get me banned on [server name here]?**

A: Um, dunno. Check with them and their rules, I suppose. In theory, it shouldn't as it's mostly optimization and *eye-candy* stuff. But still, I give **NO GUARANTEE** that you won't be banned or kicked or otherwise punished by the server for using this modpack.

**Q: Can you make this for [minecraft version here] on [mod loader here]?**

A: I could, but probably won't. This is a personal project of mine that I made in my own spare time, so unless I want/need it I'll probably won't update/downgrade it. You're free to do it yourself though, I'll gladly put it up here.

**Q: Will you add Essential to your modpack?**

A: No, I won't. I don't really like that they're close-sourced and add their own analytics. If you like this mod's features, I can recommend these alternatives:
  - **Proximity voice chat** - Plasmo Voice - already in the modpack
  - **Cosmetics** - Cosmetica - and it's free, plus already in the modpack
  - **Server hosting** - [MCSS](https://www.mcserversoft.com/) - I personally use this with [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/), it's quite easy and user-friendly, supports lots of stuff, doesn't just mess about with your port forwarding and ISP

**Q: Does this modpack support [Replay mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/replaymod)?**

A: Yes, it should be, I tested this on v1.1.0. If you plan on using it along with Plasmo Voice, be sure to grab [this addon](https://modrinth.com/mod/pv-addon-replaymod/) (if you want your voice in the replay recording).
