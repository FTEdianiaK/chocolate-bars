### About

- This modpack's purpose is to serve as an open alternative to those popular clients, such as Lunar.

- I left these since:

	A. They're not that customizable and impose a lot of stuff on the user.<br>*(You can disable anything in the modpack if you don't like it, fyi.)*
	
	B. Everywhere you go, you see the "give us money" popups and alerts.<br>*(e.g. Cosmetica offers as much cosmetics as, if not more than, Lunar and they're completely free.)*
	
	C. Have you ever checked what Lunar sends to their telemetry server when you use it? Like if it wasn't enough that you can't turn off Snooper.<br>*(Unless you have a mod, like the one in this modpack)*

*All of these below are a mystery to me, but they seem to work and do their job well, so I can fully recommend them.*

### FAQ

**Q: Will this get me banned on [server name here]?**

A: Um, dunno. Check with them and their rules, I suppose. In theory, it shouldn't as it's mostly optimization and *eye-candy* stuff. But still, I give **NO GUARANTEE** that you won't be banned or kicked or otherwise punished by the server for using this modpack.

**Q: Can you make this for [minecraft version here] on [mod loader here]?**

A: I could, but probably won't. This is a personal project of mine that I made in my own spare time, so unless I want/need it I'll probably won't update/downgrade it. You're free to do it yourself though, I'll gladly put it up here.

**Q: Will you add Essential to your modpack?**

A: No, I won't. I don't really like that they're close-sourced and add their own analytics. If you like this mod's features, I can recommend these alternatives:
  - **Proximity voice chat** - Plasmo Voice - already in the modpack
  - **Cosmetics** - Cosmetica - and it's free, plus already in the modpack
  - **Server hosting** - [MCSS](https://www.mcserversoft.com/) - I personally use this with [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/), it's quite easy and user-friendly, supports lots of stuff, doesn't just mess about with your port forwarding and ISP
